Release notes for version 8.6.5
===============================

GHC 8.6.5 is a bug-fix release, fixing a few regressions found in 8.6.4.


Highlights
----------

The highlights, since the 8.6.4 release, are:

- Binary distributions once again ship with Haddock documentation including
  syntax highlighted source of core libraries (:ghc-ticket:`16445`)

- A build system issue where use of GCC with ``-flto`` broke ``configure``
  was fixed (:ghc-ticket:`16440`)

- An bug affecting Windows platforms wherein XMM register values could be
  mangled when entering STG has been fixed (:ghc-ticket:`16514`)

- Several packaging issues with the Windows binary distributions have been resolved.
  (:ghc-ticket:`16408`, :ghc-ticket:`16398`, :ghc-ticket:`16516`).

Known issues
------------

Note that the LLVM code generator (:ghc-flag:`-fllvm`) in GHC 8.6, as well as
all earlier releases, are affected by :ghc-ticket:`14251`, which can result in
miscompilation of some programs calling functions with unboxed floating-point
arguments. While originally scheduled to be fixed for this release, the fix
ended up being more difficult than anticipated and, given that issue is not a
strict regression from 8.4, we decided to proceed with the release.

Included libraries
------------------

The package database provided with this distribution also contains a number of
packages other than GHC itself. See the changelogs provided with these packages
