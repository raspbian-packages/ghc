Release notes for version 8.6.4
===============================

GHC 8.6.4 is a bug-fix release, fixing a few regressions found in 8.6.3.


Highlights
----------

The highlights, since the 8.6.3 release, are:

- Inconsistencies between the versions of ``transformers`` and ``process``
  shipped with the compiler and those present on Hackage have been resolved
  (:ghc-ticket:`16199`).
- A patch fixing a set of linker failures on Windows has been reverted as it unfortunately caused 
  (:ghc-ticket:`15105`, :ghc-ticket:`15894`, :ghc-ticket:`15934`)
- A bug wherein changes in default method definitions would fail to trigger
  recompilation has been fixed (:ghc-ticket:`15970`).
- A bug wherein plugins would fail to lookup names not in scope in the module
  being compiled has been fixed (:ghc-ticket:`16104`)
- A bug resulting in hangs during RTS shutdown on Darwin has been resolved
  (:ghc-ticket:`16150`)
- A bug where some programs involving :extension:`StaticData` would be rejected
  with either a typechecking error or internal compiler error has been fixed
  (:ghc-ticket:`16141`)
- A bug where compilation on Windows can fail with linker errors referring to
  ``__chkstk_ms`` has been fixed (:ghc-ticket:`16166`)

Known issues
------------

Note that the LLVM code generator (:ghc-flag:`-fllvm`) in GHC 8.6, as well as
all earlier releases, are affected by :ghc-ticket:`14251`, which can result in
miscompilation of some programs calling functions with unboxed floating-point
arguments. While originally scheduled to be fixed for this release, the fix
ended up being more difficult than anticipated and, given that issue is not a
strict regression from 8.4, we decided to proceed with the release.
