Release notes for version 8.8.3
===============================

GHC 8.8.3 is a minor release intended to fix regressions and minor bugs in the
8.8.1 and 8.8.2.

Highlights
----------

- Fix a compiler panic due to over-zealous eta reduction (:ghc-ticket:`17429`).
- Fix a linker crash on Windows (:ghc-ticket:`17575`).
- Fix missing source notes in imported unfoldings when ``-g`` is used
  (:ghc-ticket:`17616`).
- Fix bootstrapping with GHC 8.8 (:ghc-ticket:`17146`).
- Bump ``directory`` submodule to 1.3.6.0, fixing :ghc-ticket:`17598`.

Known issues
------------

- A long-standing bug (:ghc-ticket:`16893`) which can cause some applications
  of ``unsafeCoerce`` to segmentation fault is only partially fixed in this
  release. This release only avoids this issue in the uses of ``unsafeCoerce``
  in ``Data.Typeable.Internal``, which was the proximate cause of
  :ghc-ticket:`16893`.

  However, it is possible that this bug could manifest in user-code using
  ``unsafeCoerce`` to perform dynamic type checks. See the :ghc-ticket:`ticket
  <16893>` for details.
