Description: The Glasgow Haskell Compilation system
 The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation system (GHC) is a compiler for
 Haskell.
 .
 Haskell is "the" standard lazy functional programming language.  The language
 definition and additional documentation can be found in the `haskell-doc'
 package.  Alternatively, there is an online version at
 http://haskell.org/onlinereport/.

Description: Profiling libraries for the Glasgow Haskell Compilation system
 The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation system (GHC) is a compiler for
 Haskell.

 Haskell is "the" standard lazy functional programming language.  The language
 definition and additional documentation can be found in the `haskell-doc'
 package.  Alternatively, there is an online version at

 This package contains additional profiling libraries. They are only needed,
 if you want to take a closer look on where exactly your program burns CPU
 cycles.

 definition and additional documentation can be found in the `haskell-doc'
 package.  Alternatively, there is an online version at

 This package includes HTML, DVI and PS versions of the SGML-based
 documentation around GHC.

Description: Dynamic libraries for the Glasgow Haskell Compilation system
 The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation system (GHC) is a compiler for
 Haskell.

 Haskell is "the" standard lazy functional programming language.  The language
 definition and additional documentation can be found in the `haskell-doc'
 package.  Alternatively, there is an online version at
 http://haskell.org/onlinereport/.
 .
 This package has dynamically linkable, shared versions of the
 libraries included with GHC.  Currently, they are available only on
 i386 and amd64 architectures.

Description: Documentation tool for annotated Haskell source code
 Haddock is a tool for automatically generating documentation from
 annotated Haskell source code.  It is primary intended for documenting
 libraries, but it should be useful for any kind of Haskell code.
 .
 Haddock lets you write documentation annotations next to the
 definitions of functions and types in the source code, in a syntax
 that is easy on the eye when writing the source code (no heavyweight
 mark-up).  The documentation generated by Haddock is fully hyperlinked:
 click on a type name in a type signature to go straight to the
 definition, and documentation, for that type.
 .
 Haddock can generate documentation in multiple formats; currently HTML
 is implemented, and there is partial support for generating DocBook.
 .
 This package contains Haddock version 2.10.0.
