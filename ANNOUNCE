   ==============================================================

The GHC Team is pleased to announce a new minor release of GHC. This is a
bug-fix release and contains a number of important fixes,

 * Various typechecker issues have been fixed, including some bugs which allowed
   the user to write unsafeCoerce

 * DWARF debug information is now more correct and supported on Windows

 * Portability issues resulting in crashes on SPARC, Linux/i386, ARM, AArch64,
   and PowerPC have been fixed

 * The event manager's multi-shot event registration functionality now works
   correctly

 * A bug where unaccounted for register aliasing could result in incorrect
   floating-point results has been fixed

 * An infinite loop during program startup when iconv is unavailable hsa been
   fixed

 * The source location of the caller of a function is now available as an implicit
   parameter to allow for better error reporting in the future

A more thorough list of the changes in the release can be found in the release
notes,

How to get it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easy way is to go to the web page, which should be self-explanatory:

        http://www.haskell.org/ghc/

We supply binary builds in the native package format for many
platforms, and the source distribution is available from the same
place.

Packages will appear as they are built - if the package for your
system isn't available yet, please try again later.


Background
~~~~~~~~~~

Haskell is a standard lazy functional programming language.

GHC is a state-of-the-art programming suite for Haskell.  Included is
an optimising compiler generating efficient code for a variety of
platforms, together with an interactive system for convenient, quick
development.  The distribution includes space and time profiling
facilities, a large collection of libraries, and support for various
language extensions, including concurrency, exceptions, and foreign
language interfaces. GHC is distributed under a BSD-style open source license.

A wide variety of Haskell related resources (tutorials, libraries,
specifications, documentation, compilers, interpreters, references,
contact information, links to research groups) are available from the
Haskell home page (see below).


On-line GHC-related resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Relevant URLs on the World-Wide Web:

GHC home page              http://www.haskell.org/ghc/

Supported Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The list of platforms we support, and the people responsible for them,
is here:

Ports to other platforms are possible with varying degrees of
difficulty.  The Building Guide describes how to go about porting to a
new platform:

Developers
~~~~~~~~~~

We welcome new contributors.  Instructions on accessing our source
code repository, and getting started with hacking on GHC, are
available from the GHC's developer's site run by Trac:

  http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/


Mailing lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We run mailing lists for GHC users and bug reports; to subscribe, use
the web interfaces at
