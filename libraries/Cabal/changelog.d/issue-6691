synopsis: Remove upgrade, uninstall and win32selfupgrade commands
packages: cabal-install
issues: #6691
prs: #6707

description: {

This commands were not implemented or are special purpose.
The removal of `win32selfupgrade` might break self upgrade on windows,
when `cabal-install` tries to rewrite the binary of itself.
This shouldn't be a problem when symlinking is used.
