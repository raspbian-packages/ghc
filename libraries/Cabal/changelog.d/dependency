description: {

With additions of (public) sublibraries, `Dependency` type use for multiple needs become painful.
Therefore a new type `PackageVersionConstraint` was added to serve *constraint on package* use-case.
`Dependency` type is *dependency on a library component*, i.e. representing `build-depends` entry.

- Use PackageVersionConstraint more
- Add NonEmptySet and use it in Dependency

}
