synopsis: Remove text type-class
packages: cabal-install
prs: #6764 #6777 #6784 #6785 #6793 #6794

description: {

`Text` type-class was removed from `Cabal`, but it still lived in `cabal-install`.
Now it is finally removed.
`cabal-install` is still using `ReadP` parsers for various things though.

}
