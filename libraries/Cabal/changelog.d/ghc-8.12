description: {

- Support for `-this-package-key` deprecation
- Use process `createPipe`
- Add support for WINIO to Cabal
- Adopt to simplfied subsumption changes

There are no magical `IO = WithCallStack Prelude.IO` alias in Cabal,
as it is hard to get working with GHC-8.12's simplified subsumption.

}
