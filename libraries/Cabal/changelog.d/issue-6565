synopsis: Update GHC environment location
prs: #6822
issues: #6565
packages: cabal-install

description: {

cabal-install currently assumes that the GHC environment files are always located in `$HOME/.ghc/`.
However, GHC itself doesn't query the home directory directly.
Instead, it uses `getAppUserDataDirectory "ghc"` which happens to coincide with `$HOME/.ghc`/ on UNIX systems.
On Windows, however, GHC ends up looking in `%APPDATA%/ghc/`.

}
