synopsis: Add support for multiple public libraries to the solver
packages: cabal-install
issues: #6039
prs: #6836 #6812 #6047

description: {

cabal-install can now take into account the presence and visibility of
sublibraries when solving. This also means that, when using cabal-install,
multiple public libraries support is extended to GHCs older than 8.8.
The support is limited to source packages for now.
